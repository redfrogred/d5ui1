# NOTES 
This is a place for stuff that doesn't fit under README

## BRANCH NAMES
"main"   
+ This will have the latest stuff I am working on.

"basic"
+ This just has navigation and two pages (Start and End).

"enhanced2"   
+ "basic" plus Provider package, plus a Config that has some simple app info and styling   

## GENERAL IDEAS
NAMING CONVENTIONS   
* variables be "lowercase_with_hyphens"   
* methods be "camelCased()"...  
* classes will be capitalized, and always have the filename exactly match the class name (so the "Config" class is "Config.dart", for instance)
